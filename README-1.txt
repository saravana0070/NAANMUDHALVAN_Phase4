COVID-19 Vaccines Analysis with Machine Learning

Overview:

This Python code is designed to perform an analysis of COVID-19 vaccine data and build a machine learning model for prediction. The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

Getting Started!

Prerequisites:

To run this code, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)

You can install the required libraries using pip:


pip install pandas scikit-learn


Installation:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/saravana0070/NAANMUDHALVAN_Phase4


2. Download your COVID-19 vaccine data in CSV format and replace `'country_vaccinations.csv'` in the code with the actual file path.

3. Open a Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook and run the code.

Project Structure:

- `country_vaccinations.csv`: The COVID-19 vaccine data file 
- `Project.ipynb`: Python script with the code.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

Code Explanation:

The Python code performs the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Loads the COVID-19 vaccine dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Removes duplicates and handles missing values.

3. **Feature Selection**: Selects relevant columns from the dataset based on the task.

4. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Uses one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into a format suitable for machine learning.

5. **Data Splitting**: Divides the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

6. **Feature Scaling**: Standardizes numerical features to ensure consistent scales.

7. **Model Training**: Trains a linear regression model to predict the target variable.

8. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model using mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score.

 Further Steps:

You can explore the following improvements:

- Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters.
- Experiment with more complex models like decision trees, random forests, or neural networks.
- Perform more extensive evaluations using a separate test set for a realistic estimate of model performance.
